Welcome to STARLAB's JupyterLab as a Service (JLaaS) environment! This space provides you with a ready-to-use platform for interactive data analysis, scientific computing, and collaborative work.

This instance comes pre-configured with a variety of popular data science libraries and tools, including:

* **Python:** The core programming language for data science.
* **JupyterLab:** An interactive web-based development environment for notebooks, code, and data.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
* **SciPy:** A library of algorithms and mathematical tools.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** A comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** A high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* **Plotly:** For interactive, browser-based charts and visualizations.
* **JupyterLab Git:** For seamless integration with Git version control.
* **JupyterLab LSP (Language Server Protocol):** Providing features like autocompletion and code hinting.
* **Jupyter Server Proxy:** Allowing access to other web applications (like VS Code) within the JupyterLab environment.
* **Jupyter Scheduler:** For scheduling and managing notebook executions.
* **JupyterLab Spreadsheet Editor:** For viewing and editing CSV files as spreadsheets.
* **Voila:** For turning Jupyter Notebooks into standalone web applications.
* **And more!**

## Getting Started

1.  **Access JupyterLab:** Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided for your JLaaS instance.

2.  **Authentication:** You might be prompted to log in using your STARLAB credentials.

3.  **Explore the Environment:** Once logged in, you'll see the JupyterLab interface. You can:
    * Browse the file system in the left sidebar.
    * Create new notebooks (`.ipynb`), text files, Markdown files (`.md`), and more using the **File** menu or the **Launcher** tab.
    * Open existing notebooks from the `work` directory.
    * Use the integrated terminal (**File > New > Terminal**) for command-line operations.

## Key Features

* **Pre-configured Environment:** All essential data science libraries are already installed and ready to use.
* **Git Integration:** Easily manage your notebooks and code with Git through the JupyterLab Git extension.
* **Language Server Support:** Benefit from code autocompletion and hints for Python and other languages.
* **Server Proxy:** Access tools like Visual Studio Code directly from within JupyterLab (look for the "VisualStudio Code" launcher icon).
* **Markdown Preview:** `.md` files will automatically open in the Markdown Preview for easy viewing.
* **Scheduled Notebooks:** Automate the execution of your notebooks at নির্দিষ্ট intervals.
* **Spreadsheet Editing:** View and edit CSV files in a familiar spreadsheet interface.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** Use Voila to turn your notebooks into interactive web applications.

## Working with Notebooks

* **Create a New Notebook:** Go to **File > New > Notebook** and select a kernel (usually Python 3).
* **Code Cells:** Write and execute Python code in code cells. Press `Shift + Enter` to run a cell.
* **Markdown Cells:** Create formatted text, lists, images, and more using Markdown syntax in Markdown cells.
* **Saving Your Work:** Notebooks are automatically saved periodically, but you can also manually save using **File > Save Notebook**.

## Accessing Other Tools (via Server Proxy)

You might find icons in the JupyterLab launcher for other pre-configured tools, such as:

* **VisualStudio Code:** A powerful web-based code editor.

Click on these icons to open the respective applications in a new tab.
